# Turbulent-like whole brain dynamics and Hopf computational model

Code used in Mart√≠nez-Molina et al. 2022 "The evolution of whole-brain dynamics during recovery from traumatic brain injury" (in preparation)

Data was downloaded from the Open Neuro repository (https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000220/versions/1.0.0/file-display/dataset_description.json) and preprocessed using the CONN toolbox (https://web.conn-toolbox.org).

The Brain Parcellation used (Schaefer 1000 nodes 7RSNs) for time-series' extraction can be found here: https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal
