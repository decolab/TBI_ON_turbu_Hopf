  "description": "This repository contains the code to run the model-free and model-based approaches as well as some inputs using the Schaefer 1000 7 RSNs parcellation. The repository is organized in six folders: (1) model-free – whole-brain turbulent-like dynamics; (2) model-based – Hopf whole-brain model with intact structural connectivity; (3) model-based-lesions – Hopf model after simulated attacks; (4) CONN_preprocessing – CONN toolbox denoising outputs; (5) time-series – inputs for model-free/model-based analyses; (6) lesion-masks – code for the simulated attack approach.",
